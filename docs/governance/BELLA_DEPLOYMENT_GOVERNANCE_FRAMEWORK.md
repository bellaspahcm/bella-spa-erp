# BELLA PLATFORM — DEPLOYMENT GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** ESTABLISHED (extracted from Amendment 12 v3)  
**Applies To:** All Bella Platform OS (Healthcare, Finance, Education, Real Estate, etc.)  
**Date:** 2026-08-20  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This framework codifies the deployment governance model proven through Amendment 12 v3 (Runtime Migration 05 Identity Reconciliation). It establishes a **multi-layer verification and authorization architecture** that separates technical verification from human authorization, ensuring database mutations occur only after comprehensive evidence gathering and explicit approval.

**Core Principle:**
> Bella does NOT use migrations to "try and see if it works". Bella uses multiple layers of evidence to decide when migrations are permitted to execute.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: Verification ≠ Authorization

**Definition:**
> Automated verification proves **readiness for human review**, NOT approval for execution.

**Implementation:**
- Automated checks can return PASS/FAIL
- Automated PASS means: "Eligible for human decision"
- Automated PASS does NOT mean: "Approved for execution"
- Human authorization is a SEPARATE gate after all automated verification

**Example from Amendment 12 v3:**
- 126/126 automated checks PASS
- Database mutations: 0
- Status: HOLD (awaiting Human GO)
- Migration execution: FORBIDDEN until Human GO

**Anti-Pattern:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Auto-execute on verification PASS
if (verificationResult.allPass) {
  executeMigration(); // NO!
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Require explicit human authorization
if (verificationResult.allPass && humanGO.authorized) {
  executeMigration();
}
```

---

### Principle 2: Fail Before Mutation

**Definition:**
> Governance systems must detect issues BEFORE database mutation, not after.

**Implementation:**
- All verification gates are READ-ONLY
- No gate execution causes database mutations
- Failed verification = database remains pristine
- Multiple verification layers before first mutation

**Evidence from Amendment 12 v3:**
- Package Integrity #1: FAIL (detected 2 gaps)
- Corrections applied
- Package Integrity #2: PASS
- Database mutations during verification: 0

**Success Metric:**
> Detecting a failure through verification gates is PROOF the governance system works, not failure of the system.

---

### Principle 3: Rollback Test ≠ Backup

**Definition:**
> Rollback tests and backups serve different purposes and are NOT interchangeable.

**Rollback Test Proves:**
- Transaction can rollback in tested failure scenarios
- Operates within transaction boundaries
- Verifies ACID properties
- Tests specific failure injection points

**Backup Provides:**
- Independent full database restoration capability
- Protection against environmental failures (disk, network, server crash)
- Protection against scenarios outside transaction scope
- Protection against catastrophic errors requiring full restoration

**Implementation:**
```bash
# ROLLBACK TEST: Verify transaction semantics
BEGIN;
  -- mutation
  -- inject failure
  -- verify EXCEPTION → ROLLBACK
ROLLBACK;
-- verify pristine state restored

# BACKUP: Independent restoration capability (MANDATORY before deployment)
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_pre_deployment.sql
# verify backup file exists, size > 0, contains valid SQL
```

**Both Required:**
- Rollback Test: Proves code handles failures correctly
- Backup: Provides recovery mechanism for unforeseen scenarios

---

### Principle 4: Controlled Execution, Not "Running Migration"

**Definition:**
> Deployment is stage-by-stage execution with verification between stages, NOT blind one-shot execution.

**Implementation:**
```
Stage 1
  ↓ [CHECKPOINT: verify stage 1 result]
  ↓ [if FAIL → STOP, investigate]
  ↓ [if PASS → proceed]
Stage 2
  ↓ [CHECKPOINT: verify stage 2 result]
  ↓ [if FAIL → STOP, investigate]
  ↓ [if PASS → proceed]
Stage 3
  ↓ [CHECKPOINT: verify stage 3 result]
  ...
```

**Critical Rule:**
> At ANY checkpoint failure: STOP immediately, investigate, decide (fix OR rollback). DO NOT proceed blindly.

**Anti-Pattern:**
```bash
# ❌ WRONG: Execute entire chain blindly
psql -f migration_01.sql && \
psql -f migration_02.sql && \
psql -f migration_03.sql
# If migration_02 fails, may leave database in inconsistent state
```

**Correct Pattern:**
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Execute with verification between stages
psql -f migration_01.sql
# → manually verify migration_01 result
# → if PASS, proceed

psql -f migration_02.sql
# → manually verify migration_02 result
# → if FAIL, STOP and investigate
```

---

### Principle 5: Scope Limitation

**Definition:**
> Human GO authorizes ONLY specific mutations explicitly documented. Any deviation requires NEW authorization.

**Implementation:**
- Document exhaustive list of authorized mutations (table/column/FK/index/trigger)
- Document NOT authorized mutations
- Define scope boundary explicitly
- Any mutation outside documented scope = NEW Human GO required

**Example Scope Definition:**
```markdown
**Authorized Mutations:**
- CREATE SCHEMA migration_evidence
- CREATE TABLE canonical_tenant_map (with specific columns)
- INSERT 5 rows into canonical_tenant_map
- CREATE 3 tenants in public.tenants
- DELETE 2 specific orphan records

**NOT Authorized:**
- Additional tenant creation beyond 3
- Deletion beyond 2 specific orphans
- RLS policy modifications
- Any schema change not listed above
```

---

## VERIFICATION GATES

### Gate E0: Artifact + Environment + Precondition Integrity

**Purpose:** Verify package integrity, dependency state, execution preconditions, and gate independence BEFORE runtime verification.

**Verification Groups:**
1. **Artifact Integrity:** Migration files exist, hashes verified, structure validated
2. **Dependency Integrity:** Database schema matches migration assumptions
3. **Execution Preconditions:** Database state correct (types, constraints, fixture count)
4. **Gate Integrity:** E1/E2/E3 gates are independent SQL functions, cannot be bypassed

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ PASS: All checks pass → proceed to Rollback Test
- ❌ FAIL: Any check fails → STOP, fix package or environment

**Example Checks:**
- Migration files exist (6 files)
- Verification scripts exist (3 scripts)
- runtime_tenant_registry.tenant_id type = TEXT
- migration_evidence schema does NOT exist yet
- PostgreSQL version >= 12
- Database user has CREATE privileges

**Typical Check Count:** 30-40 checks

---

### Rollback Test: Behavioral Verification

**Purpose:** Verify PostgreSQL transaction rollback semantics through failure injection at critical points.

**Test Scenarios (Minimum 3):**
1. **Failure after gate PASS, before mutation**
   - Inject: EXCEPTION after verification gate passes
   - Verify: Schema creation rolled back, pristine state restored

2. **Failure after partial mutation, before critical operation**
   - Inject: EXCEPTION after UPDATE but before DELETE
   - Verify: UPDATE rolled back, no leaked mutations

3. **Failure after critical operation, before verification**
   - Inject: EXCEPTION after DELETE but before count check
   - Verify: DELETE rolled back, deleted rows restored

**Verification (After Each Scenario):**
- migration_evidence schema: ABSENT
- Fixture count: INTACT (no leaks)
- Column types: PRESERVED (no type migration leaks)
- FK constraints: ABSENT (no constraint leaks)

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ PASS: All scenarios trigger rollback, pristine state verified
- ❌ FAIL: Any scenario fails to rollback, state corruption detected

**Typical Check Count:** 30-35 checks (3 scenarios × ~10 verifications)

---

### Gate E1: Runtime Precondition Verification

**Purpose:** Verify database runtime state immediately before migration execution authorization.

**Verification Checks:**
1. **Fixture Integrity:** Expected fixtures present (e.g., 5/5)
2. **RLS State:** Row-level security enabled, policies exist
3. **Migration History:** No previous execution detected
4. **Orphan Detection:** Expected orphans identified
5. **Schema Compatibility:** Column types match preconditions (e.g., TEXT not UUID)
6. **FK Absence:** No FK constraints exist yet (pre-migration state)
7. **Canonical Authority:** Canonical table exists (e.g., public.tenants)
8. **Identity Type:** Canonical identity type correct (e.g., UUID)
9. **Privileges:** Database user has required permissions

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ PASS: All checks pass → proceed to Human GO
- ⚠️ PASS WITH WARNINGS: Some checks warn but don't block
- ❌ FAIL: Any critical check fails → STOP, fix preconditions

**Typical Check Count:** 8-12 checks

---

### Human GO Decision Gate

**Purpose:** Final authorization gate requiring explicit human confirmation of 3 mandatory conditions.

**Condition 1: Backup (MANDATORY)**
- Backup file created with timestamp
- File size > 0 bytes, documented
- SQL content verified (header/footer check)
- Backup location documented
- Restore procedure documented

**Condition 2: Monitoring Plan (MANDATORY)**
- Monitoring checkpoints reviewed (typically 6-10 checkpoints)
- Gate failure protocol agreed (STOP on gate FAIL)
- Manual verification points confirmed
- Controlled execution flow agreed (no blind progression)

**Condition 3: Scope Confirmation (MANDATORY)**
- Authorized mutations list reviewed (exhaustive)
- NOT authorized mutations understood
- Scope boundary agreed
- Execution limited to documented mutations only

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ GO: All 3 conditions satisfied → authorize controlled execution
- 🟡 HOLD: Conditions not satisfied → remain in HOLD state
- ❌ NO-GO: Reject execution, additional review required

**Status Transition:**
```
126/126 Automated Checks PASS
        ↓
HUMAN GO: HOLD
        ↓
Condition 1 ✅ + Condition 2 ✅ + Condition 3 ✅
        ↓
HUMAN GO: GO
        ↓
Controlled Execution Authorized
```

### Gates E2, E3, etc.: Runtime Verification

**Purpose:** Verify state at critical points during migration execution. These gates are embedded in migration files and execute automatically.

**Characteristics:**
- **SQL Functions:** Defined as database functions, not external scripts
- **EXCEPTION on FAIL:** Raise EXCEPTION to trigger transaction rollback
- **Read-Only:** Verification only, no mutations
- **Detailed Reporting:** Return TABLE with check results

**Example: E2 Orphan Safety Gate (5-stage verification)**
1. Count check (expected orphan count)
2. Known set verification (orphans match expected IDs)
3. FK reference check (no orphans have dependencies)
4. Temporal validation (orphans meet age criteria)
5. Final verification (all checks passed)

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ PASS: All checks pass → proceed to next migration stage
- ❌ FAIL: Any check fails → EXCEPTION → transaction rollback → STOP

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### Anti-Pattern 1: Auto-Execute on Verification PASS

**Problem:** Automated verification PASS triggers immediate execution without human authorization.

**Why It's Wrong:** Violates "Verification ≠ Authorization" principle.

**Correct Approach:** Automated verification → Human GO → Execution

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Skip Backup Because Rollback Test Passed

**Problem:** Treating rollback test as replacement for backup.

**Why It's Wrong:** Rollback test verifies transaction semantics, not environmental failure recovery.

**Correct Approach:** Both required. Rollback test proves behavior, backup provides restoration.

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Blind Chain Execution

**Problem:** Execute entire migration chain without verification between stages.

**Why It's Wrong:** Failure in middle stage may leave database in inconsistent state.

**Correct Approach:** Stage → Verify → Stage → Verify → ... (with STOP on any failure)

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: Scope Creep During Execution

**Problem:** "While we're migrating, let's also add X" without new Human GO.

**Why It's Wrong:** Human GO authorized specific mutations only. Deviation requires new authorization.

**Correct Approach:** Stick to documented scope. Any addition requires NEW Human GO.

---

### Anti-Pattern 5: Weak HOLD Criteria

**Problem:** Human GO transitions to GO without explicit confirmation of 3 conditions.

**Why It's Wrong:** HOLD exists to enforce operational readiness verification.

**Correct Approach:** HOLD until Backup ✅ + Monitoring ✅ + Scope ✅, then GO.

---

## CONCLUSION

The Bella Deployment Governance Framework codifies a multi-layer verification and authorization architecture proven through Amendment 12 v3. It enforces the principle that **verification proves readiness, but only human authorization grants permission**.

### Framework Definition

**Bella Deployment Governance Framework (BDGF)** is the unified deployment control layer of Bella Platform, ensuring all changes with potential impact on data, schema, tenant isolation, financial integrity, or domain invariants must pass through an Evidence → Authorization → Controlled Execution → Verification chain before being considered complete.

### Architectural Significance

**What Makes This Different:**

Traditional approach: "Migration written → Run it → Hope it works"

Bella approach: "Evidence chain → Authorization → Controlled execution with checkpoints"

**Key Innovation: Governance is Executable**

Gates are not just documentation. Gates:
- Return PASS/FAIL programmatically
- Have stop conditions
- Have rollback semantics
- Generate evidence
- Enforce authorization boundaries
- Create audit trails

**Result:**
> Architecture → Implementation → Evidence → Authorization → Execution forms a verifiable control chain.

### Cross-OS Applicability

Domain logic may differ, but governance mechanism does NOT need rebuilding:

- **Finance OS:** Ledger integrity, reconciliation, period control, financial invariants
- **Healthcare OS:** Person/Encounter integrity, clinical provenance, tenant isolation
- **Education OS:** Enrollment, academic records, grade integrity
- **Real Estate OS:** Property ownership, transaction integrity, tenant isolation
- **Identity migrations:** Canonical identity, FK, mapping, orphan safety

**Top layer remains identical:**
> Verify → Authorize → Execute → Verify → Monitor

### Core Principle

**Bella does NOT deploy because migration is written.**

**Bella ONLY deploys when:**
1. System has generated sufficient evidence
2. Human has granted authorization
3. Each execution step has checkpoint to stop

**Critical Distinction:**
> PASS is NOT GO.  
> PASS creates eligibility to REQUEST GO.  
> Human GO creates permission to EXECUTE.

### Reference Implementation

Amendment 12 v3 is the first reference implementation of BDGF:
- 126/126 automated checks PASS
- Database mutations: 0
- Status: HOLD
- Principle: Verification ≠ Authorization (proven, not claimed)

**Key Achievement from Amendment 12 v3:**
- 126/126 automated checks PASS
- Database mutations: 0
- Status: HOLD (awaiting Human GO)
- Migration execution: FORBIDDEN until conditions satisfied

**This is the model all Bella Platform OS should follow:**

> Bella does NOT use migrations to "try and see if it works". Bella uses multiple layers of evidence to decide when migrations are permitted to execute.

**Framework Status:** ESTABLISHED  
**Mandatory Compliance:** All Bella Platform OS  
**Next Review:** After 10 deployments OR 6 months, whichever comes first
